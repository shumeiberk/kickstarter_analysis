# kickstarter_analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# background
Louise’s play Fever came close came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to do this as well? In this challenge, you’ll conduct a data analysis to answer this question and determine whether the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.

# objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

Use filters and Excel formula to create new datasets
Create visualizations using Excel charts and pivot tables
Interpret the summary data provided from the visualizations

### Module 1 - Challenge

1) Around 105 US plays failed in its kickstarter campaign with a similar length of 30 days as Louise's Fever play; however none of them were close to being >80% funded.  This shows that Fever was one of the anomalies.  
Based on the some of the graphs below as well as the statistics pulled for successul vs failed US campaigns, we can also see that campaigns with lofty goals are more challenging to fulfill.

2)  There's no indication thhat the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure.  However, based on what we do see across all kickstarter campaigns, there is an increase in success from March to May (peak in May) and then the number of successful campaigns start to decline.

# Analysis

There's a lot of variability over what drives the success or failure of kickstarter campaigns.  Based on the information we do have for this analysis, campaigns over 45k goals have less than 25% rate of success.  To increase the likelihood of a kickstarter success, the goal range should be 3,500-4000 in funding.
